      <description>Angular Router   Routing is a mechanism used by Angular framework to manage the &#34;paths&#34; and &#34;routes&#34; of our Angular applications  Routing strategy helps in navigation between various views in our Angular Application  Angular framework comes with &#34;Router&#34; Module which has everything we need to design, develop and implement routes and navigation links   Router is singleton - which means there is ONLY one instance of the router in our Angular Application  The Router module is found in the package @angular/router  We need to setup Router array - every time a request is made, the router will search in the list of array and find the most relevant match  Router has states - which helps us get important information about the current state and data related to routes  </description>
