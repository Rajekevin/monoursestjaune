      <description>About Hello 👋🏼, I like programming computers and helping others become programmers.
I started programming when I was 16, and I’ve been doing it professionally since I graduated in Web and E-business Engineering at the ESGI of Paris in 2016.
I’ve been developing software professionally for 4 years with many teams, in diverse domains. I’ve done that using many different programming languages including PHP, Javascript and many more.</description>
