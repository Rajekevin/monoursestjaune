      <description>The authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a protocol for enabling administrative access. AAA controls who is allowed to connect to the network, what they are allowed to do, and tracks records of what was done.
In small or simple networks, AAA authentication can be implemented using the local database. However, in larger or complex networks, AAA authentication should be implemented using server-based AAA. AAA servers can use RADIUS or TACACS+ protocols to communicate with client routers.</description>

      <description>We can see a lot of kinds of threats, like viruses, worms, and Trojan.A virus is malicious software attached to another program to execute unwanted actions on an end system. A worm executes arbitrary code and installs copies of itself in the memory of an infected computer, which then infects other hosts. A Trojan horse is an application that was written to look like something else.
In addition to these types of threats, there are other categories of threats, such as Reconnaissance attacks &amp;amp; DoS attacks.</description>

      <description>14 years of love story with PHP5, now finish, since the new year 2019 ! I started, learned, praticed with this version of PHP. Now PHP5, since December 31, 2018, security support for PHP 5.6.x is officially cease ; marking the end of all support for any version of the ancient PHP 5.x branch üò•
It exposes hundreds of millions of websites (who still running on PHP 5.x version), to serious security risks ‚ò†Ô∏è.</description>

      <guid>/render-html-tags/</guid>
      <description>When you store HTML tags in your database, you would like to retrieve these datas as HTML Content, not a string right ?
&amp;lt;?php echo $row[&amp;#39;description&amp;#39;]; ?&amp;gt;` Maybe when you want to display this data, it show as a string character : &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hello, I am PHP&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; Don&#39;t worry, call your best elePHPhant üêò and use htmlspecialchars_decode()
 The htmlspecialchars() function converts some predefined characters to HTML entities
 &amp;lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&amp;#39;description&amp;#39;]); ?</description>
