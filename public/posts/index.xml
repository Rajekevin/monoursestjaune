      <description>Angular Router   Routing is a mechanism used by Angular framework to manage the &#34;paths&#34; and &#34;routes&#34; of our Angular applications  Routing strategy helps in navigation between various views in our Angular Application  Angular framework comes with &#34;Router&#34; Module which has everything we need to design, develop and implement routes and navigation links   Router is singleton - which means there is ONLY one instance of the router in our Angular Application  The Router module is found in the package @angular/router  We need to setup Router array - every time a request is made, the router will search in the list of array and find the most relevant match  Router has states - which helps us get important information about the current state and data related to routes  </description>

      <description>Render HTML Tags  When you store HTML tags in your database, you would like to retrieve these datas as HTML Content, not a string right ?
&amp;lt;?php echo $row[&amp;#39;description&amp;#39;]; ?&amp;gt;`  Maybe when you want to display this data, it show as a string character : 
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hello, I am PHP&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, call your best elePHPhant üêò and use htmlspecialchars_decode()
 The htmlspecialchars() function converts some predefined characters to HTML entities</description>
