<h1 class="title"> Angular Router </h1>

<ul class="title">
    <li> Routing is a mechanism used by Angular framework to manage the "paths" and "routes" of our Angular applications</li>
    <li> Routing strategy helps in navigation between various views in our Angular Application</li>
    <li> Angular framework comes with "Router" Module which has everything we need to design, develop and implement routes and navigation links </li>
    <li> Router is singleton - which means there is ONLY one instance of the router in our Angular Application</li> 
    <li> The Router module is found in the package @angular/router</li> 
    <li> We need to setup Router array - every time a request is made, the router will search in the list of array and find the most relevant match</li> 
    <li> Router has states - which helps us get important information about the current state and data related to routes</li> 
</ul>
