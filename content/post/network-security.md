<h1 class="title"> Modern Network Security Threats </h1>

We can see a lot of kinds of threats, like viruses, worms, and Trojan.
A virus is malicious software attached to another program to execute unwanted actions on an end system. A worm executes arbitrary code and installs copies of itself in the memory of an infected computer, which then infects other hosts. A Trojan horse is an application that was written to look like something else.

In addition to these types of threats, there are other categories of threats, such as Reconnaissance attacks & DoS attacks.
Reconnaissance attacks involve the unauthorized discovery and mapping of systems, services, and vulnerabilities.
DoS attacks send extremely large numbers of requests over a network or the Internet. These excessive requests overload the target device causing performance to degrade.
