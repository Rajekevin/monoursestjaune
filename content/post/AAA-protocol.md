The authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a protocol for enabling administrative access. 
AAA controls who is allowed to connect to the network, what they are allowed to do, and tracks records of what was done.

In small or simple networks, AAA authentication can be implemented using the local database. However, in larger or complex networks, AAA authentication should be implemented using server-based AAA. AAA servers can use RADIUS or TACACS+ protocols to communicate with client routers.
