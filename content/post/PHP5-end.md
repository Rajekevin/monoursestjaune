<h1 class="title">Good Bye PHP5 [14.04.2004-31.12.2018] </h1>

14 years of love story with PHP5, now finish, since the new year 2019 !
<img src="/img/posts/post2/php5.PNG" height="350px" />

I started, learned, praticed with this version of PHP.
Now PHP5, since December 31, 2018, security support for PHP 5.6.x is officially cease ; marking the end of all support for any version of the ancient PHP 5.x branch üò•

<h2 class="title" > What does it mean ?</h2>

It exposes hundreds of millions of websites (who still running on PHP 5.x version), to serious security risks ‚ò†Ô∏è.

<h2 class="title" > what I supposed to do if I still running my website on php 5 ? </h2>
